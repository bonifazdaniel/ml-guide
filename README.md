Machine learning basic guide

Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
1.1 Installing Python
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If you don’t have it yet, download it from python.org.

1.2 Creating a Virtual Environment
To avoid conflicts with other libraries, we’ll create a virtual environment for this project. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
python -m venv env
This will create a virtual environment called env.

1.3 Activating the Virtual Environment
On Windows:
.\env\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
source env/bin/activate

1.4 Installing Required Libraries
The main libraries we’ll use for this project are:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn

Install them by running the following command:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

Step 2: Preparing the Data
In this step, we'll guide users on how to load and prepare the data for machine learning.

2.1 Selecting a Dataset
For this project, we'll use the popular Iris dataset. It's a simple dataset that contains information about three species of Iris flowers, with features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

To load the dataset in Python, use the following code:
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load the Iris dataset
data = load_iris()

# Get the features and labels
X = data.data  # Features
y = data.target  # Labels

2.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before we build any models, it's crucial to understand the data. Let’s start with some basic exploration.
import pandas as pd

# Convert the data to a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=data.feature_names)
df['species'] = y

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Statistical summary of the data
print(df.describe())

2.3 Data Visualization
Visualizing the data helps in understanding how the features relate to each other. Let's create a scatter plot to visualize the distribution of the Iris flowers.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a scatter plot between two features
plt.scatter(df['sepal length (cm)'], df['sepal width (cm)'], c=df['species'])
plt.xlabel('Sepal Length')
plt.ylabel('Sepal Width')
plt.title('Iris Flowers - Sepal Length vs Sepal Width')
plt.show()

Step 3: Building the Machine Learning Model
In this step, we will guide users on how to create and train a basic machine learning model using the dataset.

3.1 Splitting the Data
Before training the model, we need to split the dataset into training and testing sets. This will allow us to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

3.2 Choosing a Model
For this example, we’ll use a simple classification model: Logistic Regression. It’s effective for classification tasks like this one.
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Initialize the model
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200)

# Train the model on the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

3.3 Making Predictions
Now that the model is trained, we can use it to make predictions on the test set.
# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Display the predicted values
print("Predictions:", y_pred)

3.4 Evaluating the Model
To evaluate how well the model is performing, we’ll use accuracy as the metric.
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

Step 4: Improving the Model
In this step, we’ll focus on improving the model’s performance by fine-tuning it and trying different algorithms.

4.1 Hyperparameter Tuning
One way to improve the model is by fine-tuning the hyperparameters. For logistic regression, we can adjust the regularization strength (C parameter). We'll use GridSearchCV to search for the best combination of hyperparameters.
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Define the parameter grid
param_grid = {'C': [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]}

# Initialize GridSearchCV with logistic regression
grid_search = GridSearchCV(LogisticRegression(max_iter=200), param_grid, cv=5)

# Fit the grid search to the data
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print the best hyperparameters found
print("Best Hyperparameters:", grid_search.best_params_)

4.2 Trying a Different Model
We can also experiment with other models. For instance, let’s try K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), which is another popular algorithm for classification.
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Initialize the KNN model
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

# Train the KNN model
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred_knn = knn.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy_knn = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_knn)
print(f"KNN Model Accuracy: {accuracy_knn * 100:.2f}%")

4.3 Comparing Model Performance
We can now compare the performance of both models (Logistic Regression and KNN) and choose the one with the better accuracy.
# Compare the accuracy of both models
print(f"Logistic Regression Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
print(f"KNN Accuracy: {accuracy_knn * 100:.2f}%")

Step 5: Deploying the Model
In this step, we’ll show users how to deploy the trained machine learning model using a simple API.

5.1 Setting Up Flask
We will use Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, to create a simple API that allows us to interact with the model.

To get started, install Flask using pip:
pip install flask

5.2 Creating a Flask API
Now, let’s create a basic Flask app that loads the trained model and allows users to make predictions via an API endpoint.

Create a new Python file, app.py, and add the following code:
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import pickle
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Initialize the Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the Iris dataset and train a model
data = load_iris()
X, y = data.data, data.target
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200)
model.fit(X, y)

# Create a route to predict the species of a flower
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    # Get the input data from the request
    data = request.get_json()
    features = [data['features']]

    # Make a prediction using the model
    prediction = model.predict(features)

    # Return the prediction as a JSON response
    return jsonify({'prediction': int(prediction[0])})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

5.3 Running the Flask API
To run the Flask API, execute the following command:
python app.py

This will start a local server at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You can send a POST request to the /predict endpoint to make predictions.

5.4 Testing the API
To test the API, you can use a tool like Postman or cURL. Here’s an example of how to make a request using cURL:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"features": [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict

This will return a response with the predicted class of the Iris flower.

Step 6: Finalizing and Sharing the Project
In this step, we'll guide the user on how to finalize and share the project.

6.1 Saving the Model
It’s important to save the trained model so that it can be used later without needing to retrain it every time. We can use pickle to serialize the model.
import pickle

# Save the trained model to a file
with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as model_file:
    pickle.dump(model, model_file)

# To load the model later:
# with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as model_file:
#     loaded_model = pickle.load(model_file)

6.2 Documenting the Project
